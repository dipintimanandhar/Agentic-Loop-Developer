Meeting Title: Oracle to PostgreSQL Migration - SQL Query Conversion Strategy

Date: May 26, 2025
Time: 2:00 PM - 3:00 PM IST
Location: Conference Room 3B / Virtual (Zoom Link: [example_zoom_link])

Attendees:
* Sarah (Project Lead)
* John (DBA - Oracle Specialist)
* Priya (Developer - PostgreSQL Specialist)
* Mike (Application Developer)
* Rina (QA Lead)

Agenda:
1.  Review scope of Oracle SQL queries needing conversion for Project Phoenix.
2.  Identify potential complexities and challenges.
3.  Discuss tools and methodologies for conversion.
4.  Define action items and assign responsibilities for the conversion task.

Discussion Points:

* **Project Overview & Goal:** Sarah kicked off the meeting by reiterating the overall goal of migrating the "LegacyCRM" application's database from Oracle to PostgreSQL. Today's focus is specifically on the SQL query conversion aspect.
* **Scope of Conversion:**
    * John presented an inventory of approximately 250 Oracle SQL queries currently embedded in application code and 75 stored procedures/functions.
    * Mike confirmed these queries are critical for application functionality.
* **Key Challenges Identified:**
    * **Proprietary Oracle Functions:** Discussed Oracle-specific functions like `DECODE`, `NVL`, `ADD_MONTHS`, `LISTAGG`, and date formatting functions (e.g., `TO_DATE` with Oracle-specific format masks) that will need direct PostgreSQL equivalents or workarounds. Priya mentioned `CASE` statements for `DECODE`, `COALESCE` for `NVL`, and interval arithmetic or `TO_CHAR` with different patterns for date functions.
    * **PL/SQL to PL/pgSQL:** Conversion of Oracle PL/SQL blocks within stored procedures to PostgreSQL's PL/pgSQL will be a significant effort. Syntax differences in looping, variable declaration, and exception handling were highlighted.
    * **Outer Join Syntax:** Older Oracle queries might use the `(+)` syntax for outer joins, which needs to be converted to standard ANSI SQL `LEFT JOIN`/`RIGHT JOIN`.
    * **Data Type Mappings:** While mostly straightforward, potential nuances with `NUMBER` to `NUMERIC`/`INTEGER`, and `VARCHAR2` to `VARCHAR` or `TEXT` were briefly touched upon.
    * **Sequence Handling:** `ROWNUM` in Oracle needs to be replaced with `ROW_NUMBER()` window function or alternative logic in PostgreSQL. Oracle sequences (`.nextval`) have a slightly different usage pattern compared to PostgreSQL sequences.
    * **Performance Testing:** Rina emphasized the need for thorough performance testing of converted queries, as direct translations might not always be optimal.
* **Tools & Methodologies:**
    * Priya suggested using a combination of manual review and potentially some automated conversion tools (e.g., Ora2Pg for initial assessment and bulk changes, followed by manual refinement).
    * The team agreed on a phased approach:
        1.  Prioritize conversion of queries for core application modules.
        2.  Developers to work closely with DBAs for complex conversions.
        3.  Unit testing for each converted query/procedure.
* **Documentation:** All conversions and rationale for changes (especially for complex workarounds) must be documented.

Action Items:

1.  **Task: Convert Oracle SQL queries and PL/SQL blocks to PostgreSQL syntax.**
    * **Description:** Systematically convert all identified Oracle SQL queries and PL/SQL procedures/functions from the "LegacyCRM" application to be compatible with PostgreSQL. This includes addressing differences in functions, join syntax, data type handling, and procedural language constructs.
    * **Assignees:**
        * Priya (Lead for PostgreSQL syntax and PL/pgSQL conversion)
        * Mike (Application-level integration and testing of converted queries)
        * John (Support for understanding existing Oracle logic and validation)
    * **Queries to be converted:** Initial list of ~250 embedded queries and 75 stored procedures/functions (detailed list attached to project tracker: PHOENIX-123).
    * **Target Due Date (Phase 1 - Core Modules):** June 30, 2025
    * **Priority:** High

2.  **Research Ora2Pg Tool:** Priya to evaluate Ora2Pg for its effectiveness in aiding the initial conversion pass. Present findings by May 30, 2025.
    * **Assignee:** Priya
    * **Due Date:** May 30, 2025

3.  **Develop Testing Strategy:** Rina to draft a specific testing plan for validating converted SQL queries, focusing on data integrity and performance.
    * **Assignee:** Rina
    * **Due Date:** June 6, 2025

Next Steps:
* Priya to schedule a follow-up session next week to discuss Ora2Pg findings and a detailed plan for tackling the first batch of queries.
* All attendees to review the query inventory list (PHOENIX-123) for any missed items.
