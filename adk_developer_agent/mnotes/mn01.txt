Meeting Notes: Python Number Addition Feature
Date: May 23, 2025
Project: Calculator App - Phase 1
Attendees:

Sri (Lead Developer)
John (Junior Developer)
Maya (QA Engineer)
Discussion Points 
Core Requirement: The team discussed the foundational requirement of implementing a feature to add two numbers within the Python backend of the "Calculator App." This is a P0 (highest priority) task for the initial release.

Input Method:

It was agreed that for the initial implementation, the two numbers would be passed as arguments to a dedicated Python function.
Future consideration: Accepting input via a simple API endpoint.
Implementation Approach:

John suggested using the basic + operator in Python for the addition, e.g., result = num1 + num2.
Sri confirmed this is the most straightforward and Pythonic way for numerical addition.
The team briefly touched upon creating a reusable function, e.g., def add_numbers(num1, num2):, to encapsulate this logic for better modularity and testability.
Data Types:

For now, the function will assume inputs are integers or floating-point numbers.
Maya raised the point about type checking and error handling (e.g., what if a string is passed?). It was decided that basic error handling (e.g., a try-except block for TypeError) should be included in the function.
Testing:

Maya will prepare test cases including:
Positive integers
Negative integers
Floating-point numbers
Zero values
One integer and one float
Invalid input types (to check error handling)

Decisions 
A Python function named add_numbers(num1, num2) will be created.
The function will use the + operator for addition.
Basic type checking and TypeError handling will be implemented within the function.
The function should return the sum.

Action Items 
John: Develop the add_numbers(num1, num2) function with error handling. (Due: May 27, 2025)
Maya: Create unit tests for the add_numbers function based on the discussed scenarios. (Due: May 28, 2025)
Sri: Review John's implementation and Maya's test cases. (Due: May 29, 2025)

Next Meeting: May 30, 2025, to review progress and discuss the next arithmetic operation.
